# node-typescript-nestjs-starter

**Starter for [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/) projects using [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)**

</div>

## What it does

This is a starter project for NodeJS backend applications, based on the **[NestJS](https://nestjs.com/)** framework, written in
**[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)**. The setup comes with tasks for building and testing the application, further
aspects like linting and / or formatting are not defined but can easily be added on top.

**Here is where things get interesting:** This starter project uses **[ncc](https://github.com/zeit/ncc)** as its build tool. This enables
us to deliver the production build of the application as a single minified JavaScrip bundle. _No copying of `node_modules` is necessary, no
`npm install` on servers required!_

> Also see the official **[Nest Framework TypeScript Starter](https://github.com/nestjs/typescript-starter)**.
